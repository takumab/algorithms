# Merge sort is recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half.
# If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted already.
# If list has more than item we split the list in half.
# Then recursively invoke/call merge sort on both halves.
# Once two halves are sorted, we call merge.
# Merge takes two smaller sorted list and combines them together in a single,
# sorted, new list.
